        <p>This was my first webpage, where I simply learned how basic things worked with HTML</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/NoahJpg/hello-world.git">Hello World</a></li>
        <p>This was another page, where I learned some more HTML</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/NoahJpg/goodbye-world.git">Goodbye World</a></li>
       <p>This page is where things got grim and I said goodbye to the world with HTML</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/NoahJpg/box-model.git">Box Model</a></li>
       <p>In this one I learned the box model, working with css and < div > elements to interact with the HTML</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am from <em>Florida</em>, but have always dreamed of living in the <em>Pacific Northwest</em> since I first came here in 2015. <br> The flat Florida landscape was never very inpsiring to me as a photographer and an <strong>avid</strong> outdoor lover. <br> The PNW felt like it had all I needed. <br> <br> So, in July of 2022, I sold the house I bought at 19 for a bunch of money and sent all of our stuff here. <br> Meanwhile my amazing wife, two wild cats, and I drove 3,000 miles to the furthest domesic city from our home (the cats did <strong>NOT</strong> pull their weight behind the wheel).</p>

  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p><span class="emphasis">My History</span> <br> The things I've acomplished and done before that brought me here.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="year">2021</span> I began my coding journey learning basics of Python and later the basics of C</li>
    <li><span class="year">2019-2022</span> I held the role of Director of Video at WealthPress</li>
    <li><span class="year">2016-2019</span> I was the fulltime Video Editor for Pragmatic Works</li>
    <li><span class="year">2012-2016</span> I attended Middleburg High School and studied video and the arts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I decdied to enroll in coding bootcamp because I wanted to change my career field, and after spending many nights learning on my own, I felt that I needed some guidance and assistance to keep going, and help when I got lost. I started coding because I was sick of the videography field, unless you go to college (overpriced), it's hard to make more money and most people hiring for video/photo work do not appreciate the work that goes into it. </p>

  <h2><span class="altheader">My Interests, Hobbies, and Skills</span></h2>
  <p><span class="altheader">I love photography, specifially analog. I spend my free time either walking near where I live and taking photos, or going on a journey to the mountains. More recently I have enjoyed discovering towns/cities near my new home and documenting things that catch my eye, such as light, man & nature intertwined, or vast landscapes. I am deeply passionate about cinema and music; I am always listening to something new and if I have time I am watching an old arthouse film or something new that interests me. I also play lots of videogames from any genre but specifially I love CRPGs and 3D platformers.</span></p>
