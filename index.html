        <p>This was my first webpage, where I simply learned how basic things worked with HTML</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/NoahJpg/hello-world.git">Hello World</a></li>
        <p>This was another page, where I learned some more HTML</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/NoahJpg/goodbye-world.git">Goodbye World</a></li>
       <p>This page is where things got grim and I said goodbye to the world with HTML</p>
     <li><a href="https://github.com/NoahJpg/box-model.git">Box Model</a></li>
       <p>In this one I learned the box model, working with css and < div > elements to interact with the HTML</p>

<div class="about-me">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am from Florida, but have always dreamed of living in the Pacific Northwest since I first came here in 2015. The flat Florida landscape was never very inpsiring to me as a photogrpher and an avid outdoor lover. The PNW felt like it had all I needed. So, I sold the house I bought at 19 for a bunch of money so my wife, two cats, and all of our stuff could be sent here. Meanwhile we drove 3,000 to the furthest domesic city.</p>

  <h2>My Interests, Hobbies, and Skills<h2>
  <p>This is the things I <span class="bold">love</span> and the activities I enjoy and my abilities I have developed.</p>
  <p>I love photography, specifially analog. I spend my free time either walking near where I live and taking photos, or going on a journey to the mountains. More recently I have enjoyed discovering  towns/cities near my new home and documenting things that catch my eye, such as light, man & nature intertwined, or vast landscapes. I am deeply passionate about cinema and music; I am always listening to something new and if I have time I am watching an old arthouse film or something new that interests me. I also play lots of videogames from any genre but specifially I love CRPGs and 3D platformers. </p>
